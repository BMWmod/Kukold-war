		Detonators:
		Contact:	When the warhead makes physical contact with the target, the explosive is detonated. Sometimes combined with a delay, to detonate a specific amount of time after contact.
		Proximity:	Using radar, sound waves, a magnetic sensor, or a laser the warhead is detonated when the target is within a specified distance. It is often coupled with directional explosion control system that ensures that the explosion sends the fragmentation primarily towards the target that triggered it.
		Remote:		Remotely detonated via signal from operator (Not normally used for warheads except for self-destruction).
		Timed:		Warhead is detonated after a specific amount of time.
		Altitude:	Warhead is detonated once it falls to a specified altitude.
		Combined:	Any combination of the above.
