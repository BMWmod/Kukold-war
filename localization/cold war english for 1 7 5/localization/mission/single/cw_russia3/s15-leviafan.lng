	{"02" "I'm spotted, enemy search radar is active."}
	{"03" "Seventh, look for Hawkeye as you look for bread. It is necessary to knock out their AWACS, without it we will have at least comparable chances."}
	{"04" "Yes! Almaz, I see Hawkeye, transmitting the coordinates!"}
	{"05" "It seems to me that in the northern part of the square, the chances of finding a target are higher. CSG is moving from the north."}
	{"06" "Good, got him. Resuming patrol."}
	{"07" "Looks like Hawkeye is evaded us. Bad, he'll be back."}
	{"08" "Air group, get ready. Together with the Indian MiGs from Vikrant, we now have 26 planes. Vikramaditya will cover both us and the convoy, while we protect fleet strike group."}
	{"09" "Every \"Nimitz\" carries twice more, and we have three against us. Therefore, work carefully, interact with the ship's air defense, exhaust Lightnings. Remember, they will be running low on fuel, they cannot fight for a long time."}
	{"10" "Good luck to all. Mount up!"}
	{"11" "Damn I'm hit, ejecting!"}
	{"12" "Attention to convoy, we have perimeter breakthrough, enemy anti-ship missiles incoming!"}
	{"13" "The transport convoy is covered by missile destroyers from Russia, China, and India. They will be able to shoot down a certain number of missiles launched from planes that have broken through, but their ammunition load is limited and replenishes very slowly on the move."}
	{"14" "Try not to miss enemy planes in large groups, four F-35s are more dangerous than two separate pairs, as they launch missiles in a salvo."}
	{"15" "Defend a transport convoy by intercepting enemy planes with ASM. Prevent the sinking of more than 50 transports. (50CP, -1CP per sunk)"}
	{"16" "Bistriy, Ushakov, this si fleet HQ. Report the situation."}
	{"17" "This is Bistriy, Comrade Vice Admiral! Multiple contacts with enemy fighters, expecting a missile strike. The air defense is ready."}
	{"18" "Follow a group of orders \"Green-4\". Additionally, try to thin out the attacking enemy groups. Anti-sub ships will support you. "}

	{"25" "We must not allow not only sinking, but also spotting of submariners. If Yankees identify submarines as \"Antey\"-class, CSG will immediately break contact and escape."}
	{"26" "There are no \"Orions\" in the area, F-35 can't spot submarines, but enemy submarines and destroyers are extremely dangerous. It is necessary to keep them away from \"Anteys\"."}
	{"27" "HQ, there are too many of them! We can't stop them by aviation only, the help of the fleet is needed!"}
	{"28" "Watch your fuel! Whoever is running low, or the missiles are out - we are waiting for landing."}
	{"29" "\"Ushakov\", \"Bistriy\", maneuver with caution. Do not stay under a direct hit from passing air group, the AK-630 alone will not be able to fight back."}
	{"30" "To \"Kuznetsov\" wing: guys, don't forget about our ships. Their air defense systems will protect you from attacking enemy fighters - lure them under fire of \"Uragan\" SAMs, and then finish off the defenseless missile carriers."}
	{"31" "11:00. The group of destroyers and anti-sub ships is heading north."}
	{"32" "12:00. Anti-sub group and \"Admiral Ustinov\" cruiser accompanies missile submarines."}

	{"35" "Found something! It looks like Los, transferring the bearing!"}
	{"36" "Anti-sub ships -  attack the enemy's submarine forces!"}
	{"37" "Submarines are immune to missiles and projectiles. Use torpedoes or rocket torpedoes loaded into torpedo tubes to destroy them."}
	{"38" "Anti-sub ship 1155 is also armed with eight \"Rastrub\" missile torpedoes in two quad launchers under the bridge."}
	{"39" "Cruisers and Anti-sub ships are equipped with a powerful sonar station capable of detecting moving enemy submarines at a considerable distance. "}
	{"40" "But the enemy's detection means are no worse, so keep your ships near the guarded cruisers. Their noises will make it difficult to detect your submarine cruisers."}
	{"41" "All planes in the air - we have an emergency, a cable break during landing. Landing is allowed only with low fuel level, takeoff canceled for half an hour."}
	{"42" "All aircraft in the air: takeoff and landing operations resumed."}
	{"43" "This is Varfolomeev! 11th division is ready for launch, cruisers of both northern and southern groups are in positions! I'm waiting for the order."}
	{"44" "Do it, Valeriy Vladimirovich, rub them into dust. The time has come."}

	{"62" "Alexander Alekseevich, there is a picture from the satellite, transmitting."}
	{"63" "So ... Yes, judging by the satellite picture, there are two large fires in the center of the order. Ignitions are visible on the escort ships, and their number has clearly diminished."}
	{"64" "Remnants of the 43rd Brigade, supported by cruisers \"Moscow\" Ð¸ \"Varyag\", I order to complete the destruction of the enemy aircraft carrier formation.. "}
	{"65" "Now all enemy forces are concentrated in one place, but they are deprived of the opportunity to effectively attack surface ships - if at least one aircraft carrier remained afloat, it clearly cannot raise aircraft."}
	{"66" "That's enough of them. All ships - stop pursuing the enemy and return to the transport convoy. Enough with them, and we need a respite too. \"Kuznetsov\" - resume air patrol. Anti-submarine helicopters from warships and rescue ships - recover crew from sunken ships in the prescribed manner."}
